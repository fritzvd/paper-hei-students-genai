"the rhetoric of anthropomorphism can do more harm than good when it comes to conceptualizing

_"How can one seek to apply existing technology to a problem, knowing that no matter what platform one decides to work on, it is almost sure that some new technology will soon pass it by? Perhaps the best solution is not, therefore, to look at technology for our solutions, but to examine our needs."_ @ervinCanTechnologyFulfill1993
