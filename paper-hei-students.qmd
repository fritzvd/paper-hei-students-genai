## Introduction

Recent developments have seen generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) being available for the masses with Large Language Models (LLM's) having a much easier interface for non-technical users. Often signified with the moniker: AI or with magical stars (✨) it features in many applications ranging from web search to [@googleGoogleAIMode;@duckduckgoDuckaiDuckDuckGoHelp; @microsoftIntroducingNewBing] personal communication such as Outlook [@ChatCopilotOutlook] or Whatsapp [@metaMetaAIWhatsApp]. genAI is quickly becoming embedded in all sorts of business and applications [@grantham-philipsAIBecomingIngrained2024].
Even more than in applications beforehand users are encouraged to upload documents and provide more context for the LLM to perform better.

As a result of the increased use of genAI, such as LLM's, a great variety of topics have been researched in the last few years. Such as environmental impact [@dingSustainableLLMServing2024; @rillig2023risks], closing and / or widening of the digital divide [@carterExploringIntersectionDigital2020; @sartoriMindingGapsPublic2023]. In the context of education, and higher education specifically research has been conducted concerning a number of topics including: guidelines and policy [@wangGenerativeAIHigher2024], about usage, knowledge and skills [@suonpaaStudentsPerceptionsGenerative2024; @silvennoinenStudentsUsageGenAI2025], personalized learning [@zhangDesigningGenAITools2025; @udehRoleGenerativeAI2025], the effect on learning outcomes [@hanImpactGenAILearning2025] and the use of genAI in collaborative learning [@perifanouCollaborativeUsesGenAI2025].

The question this paper therefore puts forward is:

## Research Questions

How do students in higher education experience human agency and liberty in using GenAI tools?

Subquestions:

- What do HEI students use genAI for?
- What kind of information do they share with the system to get what they want?
