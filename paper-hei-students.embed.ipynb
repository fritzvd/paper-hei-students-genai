    "Recent developments have seen generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) being available for the masses with Large Language Models (LLM’s) having a much easier interface for non-technical users. Often signified with the moniker: AI or with magical stars (✨) it features in many applications ranging from web search to \\[@googleGoogleAIMode;@duckduckgoDuckaiDuckDuckGoHelp; @microsoftIntroducingNewBing\\] personal communication such as Outlook \\[@ChatCopilotOutlook\\] or Whatsapp \\[@metaMetaAIWhatsApp\\]. genAI is quickly becoming embedded in all sorts of business and applications \\[@grantham-philipsAIBecomingIngrained2024\\]. Even more than in applications beforehand users are encouraged to upload documents and provide more context for the LLM to perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the increased use of genAI, such as LLM’s, a great variety of topics have been researched in the last few years. Such as environmental impact \\[@dingSustainableLLMServing2024; @rillig2023risks\\], closing and / or widening of the digital divide \\[@carterExploringIntersectionDigital2020; @sartoriMindingGapsPublic2023\\]. In the context of education, and higher education specifically research has been conducted concerning a number of topics including: guidelines and policy \\[@wangGenerativeAIHigher2024\\], about usage, knowledge and skills \\[@suonpaaStudentsPerceptionsGenerative2024; @silvennoinenStudentsUsageGenAI2025\\], personalized learning \\[@zhangDesigningGenAITools2025; @udehRoleGenerativeAI2025\\], the effect on learning outcomes \\[@hanImpactGenAILearning2025\\] and the use of genAI in collaborative learning \\[@perifanouCollaborativeUsesGenAI2025\\].\n",
